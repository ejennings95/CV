## Elliot Jennings


My strengths lie within two main areas; logic-based methodology and interpersonal skills.

I am from a non-coding background. I went to the University of Warwick to study politics with a philosophical focus. After graduating with a year abroad in Melbourne, I joined a media company specialising in finance as part of the sales team – I always thought that understanding sales is important at every level of every job.

Whilst I realised that I may be able to make a successful career in sales, I wanted more. I needed something more technical and stimulating. I began to teach myself the basics of coding during my lunch breaks. I was drawn to the logical structure of its foundations through to the opportunity to be creative and show your personality in how and why you write the code. The issue was I had no experience in coding… yet.

I managed to achieve a spot on one of the most sought-after development bootcamps - Makers Academy. I relished the chance to improve my technical abilities through programming. This has provided me with the opportunity to achieve the job I have spent the last few years of my life pursuing. My aim is to work in a relationship focused aspect of programming to combine what I have always believed my strengths to be.

Most importantly it will allow me to have the career I have been working for.

|   [Bank](https://github.com/ejennings95/Bank)                        |  This was a mock tech test to create a program based on a bank account. I focused on TDD and encapsulation for this. |       Ruby, Rspec                 |
| [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/ejennings95/Boris-bikes-javascript) |  I wrote this based on a previous project I had done to help with my learning of Javascript. This also allowed me to focus on the principles of coding taught at Makers. |     JavaScript, Jasmine           |
|[Hoot!](https://github.com/wise-social2/Hoot-App/tree/master)  | My team created an app providing an intermediary for young and old to share time and experiences together in an attempt to combat loneliness in the elder generation. | Java, Android studios, Firebase (Auth, Storage, Real-time database), Expresso, Jenkins |
|[Jungl-Book](https://github.com/ejennings95/Acebook-Simian-Sinister)  |  This is a clone of facebook. Here you can signup with a profile picture and post to the feed. My team decided to take a jungle theme (with a live stream of jungle in the background) to make the project fun while rewarding. |   Rails, RSpec/Capybara, Postgres with ActiveRecord, HTML, CSS            |

## Skills

#### Thrive under pressure

This comes down to being well organised and in control of your time.

With one  week before my  first big event at Infopro Digital there was 12 K to secure from clients. I had spent time cultivating leads and speaking to my prospects and subsequently knew how much would still be sold. This calm approach under pressure meant we hit target without panic.

#### Analytical thinker

I studied Politics at University focusing on the Philosophical side. This was an essay based subject but at its core; problem solving without a ‘correct’ answer. This is similar to programming in the sense that you can successfully solve a problem in many ways.

This skill aligns with solving a problem in code: analyse and understand the issue, research solutions, write the solution, refactor to improve its readability.

#### Strong written communication

This follows on from the above, understanding the meaning behind a piece of writing is one thing, it is another to express your own thoughts and analysis in a manner which is accessible to others. You need to have an appreciation for the final product over anything else.

This is a skill I will be able apply when writing code. The final product is far more important than words on a piece of paper or code in a text-editor.

#### Building relationships

I was successful in sales because I used a consultative sales method. This means I was looking to find a solution to solve my clients problems rather than trying to convince them to buy something that was of no use to them.

In project teams at Makers, I found that listening to my team rather than pushing ahead with my own ideas ultimately helped our workflow.
