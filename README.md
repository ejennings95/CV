## Elliot Jennings


My strengths lie within two main areas; logic-based methodology and interpersonal skills.

I am from a none-coding background. I went to the University of Warwick to study politics with a philosophical focus. After graduating with a year abroad in Melbourne, I joined a media company with a financial background. I was to join the sales team – I always thought that understanding sales is important at every level of every job.

While I realised that I may be able to make a successful career in sales, I wanted more. I was looking for something more technical and stimulating. I was missing the love of the job - this is what drives me.

I began learning to program during my lunch at work and in my free time. I was drawn to the logical structure of its foundations through to the opportunity to be creative and show your personality in how and why you write the code. The issue was I had no experience in coding… yet.

I managed to achieve a spot on one of the most sought-after development bootcamps - Makers Academy. I am relishing the chance to improve my technical abilities through programming. This has provided me with the opportunity to achieve the job I have spent the last few years of my life pursuing. One day I wish to work in a relationship focused aspect of programming. This would allow me to combine what I have always believed my strengths to be.

Most importantly it will allow me to have the career I have been waiting for.


## Skills

#### Thrive under pressure

This comes down to being well organised and in control of your time.

In terms of my time in sales, my focus was always in the preparation and building foundations early. This approach helped me exceed target for my first big event at Infopro Digital despite having 12k left to sell and just a week to go. Because I had spent time cultivating leads and speaking to my prospects I knew how much was still to come in and when. This calm approach under pressure meant we hit target without panic.

#### Analytical thinker and communicator

I very much enjoyed studying politics at University. While I knew this was not going to be my future, there was a satisfaction through understanding such a well respected academic literature.
I learnt how to read a sophisticated piece of writing and break it down into more simple blocks which enabled me to digest it. This would allow me to truly understand what the author meant.

The importance of communication came through essay writing. It is one thing to understand what you read, it is another to express your own thoughts and analysis in a manner which is accessible to other.
By taking your first draft and be willing to deconstruct it and improve the weakest links through further research is a necessity when analysing academic literature. You need to have an appreciation for the final product over anything else. This is a skill I will be able apply when writing code. The final product is far more important than words on a piece of paper or code in a text-editor.

#### Building relationships

Sales is all about relationships. Throughout my time in sales I would never try to convince a client to buy something that was not of use to them. Instead, to grow a relationship, I would try to understand their problem, and if possible, provide a solution. If this was not possible, I would stay in touch until our paths collided. This is a consultative sales method and comes to fruition in terms of long term growth over short term fixes.

#### Team player

During my time at Infopro Digital I was promoted to senior position within my team. The idea of this was to create a bridge between the team and management. I was given this opportunity to help the newest members. I was chosen as I had accomplished my targets while at the company and was seen as accessible to the whole team. I was there to offer advice and positive encouragement. I also occasionally lead the team strategy meetings where we could brainstorm and help each other.

#### Finisher-completer

I enjoy the satisfaction of successful project work. This has been seen throughout my life, whether it is an essay, an event or even planning a holiday. I like the fact that it is always slightly different than the last one and then an overwhelming sense of achievement when it comes to fruition.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2018 - March 2019)

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp (10% acceptance rate) emphasising:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine
- Passionate about code: there is a difference between wanting to finish a code so it works and wanting to finish a code perfectly. The latter is important not only to be successful but also in order to feel that sense of achievement and pride in what you do.
- Fast, independent learner: when applying to Makers this is important. Once accepted you have to complete the pre-course without time spent with a tutor. This idea of being given a problem and being told to solve it is something that will happen throughout work as a developer and gave me an insight into the importance of patience and resilience.
- Great collaborator: throughout this course our focus is working with our peers. This is a skill you learn throughout University and something which you can always improve on. I relished the chance to practice this again in another format and learn different approaches to the same problem.
